# Image analysis for S. pombe cell division
This repository contains code used for image analysis of S. pombe cells where nuclear envelope components are fluorescently-labelled. Below is a brief description of the different methods available here - if you think something might be useful for your data, obviously feel free to play with the code yourself, but also don't hesitate to contact me (Si√¢n - sian.culley@kcl.ac.uk) if you have a specific application :)
